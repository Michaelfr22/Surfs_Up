# Surfs_Up

## Overview

When opening a new business, it is required to have a deep understanding of the setting where the business will run. If attempting to start a new store that sells surf boards and ice cream, it should be in an environment that is within close distance to the beach and represents "summer" weather. The purpose of this analysis was to review weather data from Oahu, Hawaii to ensure that a surf board and ice cream business (Waves and Ice Cream) could have sustained growth in the tropical location.

## Results

To truly visualize the range of temperature in the city of Oahu, summary statistics were found in the months of June and December.

#### Key Takeaways

 - **There are 183 more weather data points for June than for December**
 - **The average temperature in June is about 3.9 degrees (F) warmer than in December:** there is little temperature variability between the summer and winter seasons.
 - **The coldest temperature recorded in December is 56 degrees (F)**

## Summary

After reviewing the Oahu, HI weather data involving temperature and precipitation, its evident that additional analysis must be completed to confidently determine if investing in Waves and Ice Cream would be worthwhile. Combining the initial findings of little temperature variability with unpredictable annual prepicipation patterns proves that additional data points, such as tide and overcast patterns should be considered to further understand the Oahu environment.
